                Not everyone can afford yearly subscription plans at paid streaming services, especially when the pandemic hits us hard these recent years. Therefore, demands for free anime streaming have increased sharply lately. However, not all free sites are safe. Most sites are ad-supported and ads can carry cyber threats from computer viruses and malware. To watch anime online for free is one thing, to watch it safely is another. And it is the reason WeAnime is now updated with the ad-free feature. Your safety matters the most to us and we understand everyone deserves to immerse themselves into the anime world with no worries. At WeAnime, you can watch your favorite anime not only freely, but also safely and smoothly

                What is wrong with WeAnime?
            </h2>
            <h3 class="sixth">
                There is nothing wrong with the site. Anime is not only short animation, some anime series even comprises thousands of episodes. With the widespread promotion of Japanese newspapers and television, more and more people fall in love with this style of Japanese film and television animation. In its home country, there are about 40 million Japanese people who watch anime. Anime is normally based on popular manga (comics), games, or ranobe such as One-Punch Man, Death Note, Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, etc. WeAnime certainly has something suitable for all ages and genders. No matter what genre you are up for today, you are highly likely to find interesting titles to quench your thirst.

                Is KissAnime better than WeAnime?

            <h3 class="eight">
                KissAnime and WeAnime are among the most popular sites for free anime streaming. It was difficult to choose which site was better in the past. However, as WeAnime is now updated with the ad-free feature, we are confident to be the better one. If given a choice, you should always go with a site with no ads for your safety and a seamless streaming experience. Not to mention that the content library, as well as features WeAnime owns, is also better than those of KissAnime.

                If WeAnime is accessible in your region, it is legal to stream anime online using the site. According to copyright attorneys, watch anime online is not considered but downloading and sharing pirated files is. Therefore, to avoid possible criminal or civil charges, you should stick with anime online streaming only. To download videos with safety, you should use a reliable VPN to stay anonymous.

                Like any other popular site, WeAnime is prone to be fake. After the original site was shut down, fake WeAnime sites are mushrooming everywhere. WeAnime.is is currently the one and only official WeAnime site on the Internet, and you should avoid other sites with WeAnime in their domain names at all costs for your safety. To check if WeAnime.is is the real site is really easy. If you have been familiar with the original WeAnime, you will get the same vibe here. The quality has got better, but we still keep features that created the popularity for WeAnime. Check out this list, visit the site and be your own judge!
